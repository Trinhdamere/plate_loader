A calculator to determine how many of each plate type are to be put on each side of the barbell. 

This app is hosted at: https://trinhdamere.shinyapps.io/plate_loader/

I made this APP after completing the "Building Web Applications in R with Shiny" Datacamp course. 
It's purpose was to practise my R Shiny skills.
